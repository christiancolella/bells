# bells
A pack that adds bells with different pitches.

## How to use
Put `bells_rp` in your `resourcepacks` folder, and put `bells_dp` in the `datapacks` folder of whichever world you want to use this pack in. Use `/tag @s add bells` to enter the hotbar UI for placing pitched bells. Bells ring when right-clicked and when powered with redstone. That's about it, really. Enjoy the pack!
